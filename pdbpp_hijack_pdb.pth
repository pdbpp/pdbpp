# Add our "_pdbpp_path_hack" to the beginning of `sys.path` if:
# 1. the environment variable PDBPP_HIJACK_PDB is trueish (as an int), defaults to 1.
#    i.e. PDBPP_HIJACK_PDB=0 can be used to disable it.
# 2. there is not another one already at the beginning
#    (e.g. via a virtualenv using "include-system-site-packages")
