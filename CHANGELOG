CHANGELOG
=========

Changes between 0.10.2 and 0.10.3
=================================

Minor bugfix release, moving Continuous Integration from Travis/AppVeyor to
GitHub Actions, based on changes on master, but without the (more invasive)
(test) fixes for Windows.

- Fixes

  - Fix hideframe decorator for Python 3.8+ (#263)
  - Fix hidden_frames discrepancy with IPython (#426)

- Misc

  - ci: move to GitHub Actions (#444, #445)
  - ci: use .coveragerc (#304)
  - qa/flake8 fixes
  - test fix for newer PyPy3

Changes between 0.10.0 and 0.10.2
=================================

Minor bugfix release to make pdb++ work better with a system-wide installation
from within a virtualenv.

  - Fix pth hack: skip if added already (#297)

Version 0.10.2 fixes only the deployment configuration.

Changes between 0.9.15 and 0.10.0
=================================

- Changes

- Fixes

  - Fix get_stack for non-last index (#192)

    This fixes a pretty nasty bug, which was triggered e.g. with the "next"
