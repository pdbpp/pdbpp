- fix issue 20: support argument-free post mortem

Changes between 0.7.1 and 0.7.2
===============================

- don't crash with newer versions of ``py.test``

Changes between 0.7 and 0.7.1
=============================

- The ``pp`` (pretty print) command now uses the actual width of the terminal,
  instead of hardcoding 80 columns

- py.test and unittest internal frames are hidden by default (type ``help
  hidden_frames`` for more info)

- don't crash if ``py`` is installed but ``py.test`` is not
